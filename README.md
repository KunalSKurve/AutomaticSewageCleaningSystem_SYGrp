# AutomaticSewageCleaningSystem_SYGrp

In this project, the proposed concept is to replace the manual work in drainage cleaning by
an automated system. Nowadays in all industries, the work takes place automatically this is
necessary to all the industries without any system efforts. The work is going on by using the
automatic technique. In the present day, however, automation plays an important role in all
industry applications. Disposal of sewage waste from industries is a difficult job. This is one
challenging task in industries and commercials. In older days people were using drainage
pipes because they use to remove sewage water. There is a disadvantage which may be loss
of human life when work in that drainage pipes is going on while cleaning the block. To
reduce this problem and to save human life some external work is done in this project. The
device is placed across drain so that only water flow through lower grids contains waste
bottles paper etc are lifted by teeth that are connected by a chain.
